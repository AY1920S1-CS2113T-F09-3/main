## 1. Introduction  
Eggventory is an inventory management system targeted towards engineering laboratory inventories. It is designed to make tracking of stock and inventory fast and painless. There are visual elements for all functionalities which makes learning the system easy, but there are also command-line equivalents that allow advanced users to do everything in one or two short commands.  
  
## 2. Quick start  
  
1. #### [Download and install Java 11 on your machine. ](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html)  
2. #### [Download the latest eggventory.jar the github repository. ](https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-3/main)  
3.   #### Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your inventory management system.  
4. #### Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.  
 
    ![](images/gui_startup.png)
  
5. #### Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it  
   - Typing help and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.  
  
6. #### Some example commands you can try:  
    
    - `add stocktype Resistors` : Creates a category of stock named “Resistors”. 
         
    - `add stock Resistors R500 200 500-ohm resistor` : Creates a new stock item with 200 500-ohm resistors and a stock code of “R500”, under the “Resistors” Stock Type.  
          
    - `edit stock Resistors R500 50` : Reduces the stock count of item R500 (500-ohm resistor) to 50.  
          
    - `add stocktype Capacitors`: Creates a category of stock named "Capacitors".
    
    - `add stock Capacitors C1k 75 1000pF` :  Creates a new stock item with 75 1000pF Capacitors and stock code “C1k”. The stock type will be defaulted to “Uncategorised”.   
         
    - `list stocktype Resistors` : Displays all stock that is categorised as Resistors.  
          
    -  `bye` : exits the app    
  
7. #### Refer to Section 3 for a more detailed list of commands you can use.  
    
## 3. Features and command usage  
  
The following section describes the command line interface commands that Eggventory recognises. Each command you input has to follow a specific format of words and parameters.  
  
Command Format    Text in <Angled Brackets> are mandatory parameter to be supplied by the user. E.g. add stocktype <Stock Type> , <Stock Type> is a parameter which is the name of the stocktype the user wishes to add.  
  
- Parameters in {Braces} can be repeated multiple times in the same command, separated by a space. E.g. loan add <Matric. No> {<Stock Code> <Quantity>} , more <Stock Code> <Quantity> pairs can be added after the first pair as such: `loan add A0191234A R500 20 R250 10 R100 5`  
  
-   [coming in v2.0] Some commands have optional parameters available. Optional parameters are added to the end of the corresponding command, after all mandatory parameters. E.g. `add stock R500 50 “500-ohm Resistors” -st Resistors` , will create a new stock, and placed under the “Resistors” Stock Type with the “-st” tag.  
  
### 3.1 Viewing help: ``help``  
  
General help: Displays a basic list of commands and their input formats.  
  
Format: `help`  
  
Specific help: Displays a more detailed list of commands of that type, with information about each input required.  
  
Format: `help <Command>`  
  
eg. `help edit`

  ### 3.2 Working with Stock Types  
Stock Types are the main categories of the inventory, and each Stock Type stores multiple Stocks. For example, your inventory may have Stock Types such as Resistors, Tools or Wires. You are required to add your Stock Types to the inventory before Stocks can be added. By default, Eggventory comes with an Uncategorised Stock Type, where Stocks not assigned to a specified Stock Typee added.  
  
Note: Stock Type names are not allowed to have spaces in them.  
  
#### 3.2.1 Adding new Stock Types: `add stocktype`  
  
This adds a new category of stock to the inventory.  
  
Format: `add stocktype <StockType> ` 

eg. add stocktype Resistor  
  
#### 3.2.2 Deleting Stock Types: `delete stocktype`  
    
This removes a stocktype from the inventory, and all stock under it.  
  
Format: `delete stocktype <StockType>`  

#### 3.2.3 Editing Stock Types: `edit stocktype`

#### 3.2.4 Listing Stock Types: `list stocktype`  
  
This lists out all Stock Types that are present in the inventory.  
  
Format: `list stocktype all`  

---  
### 3.3 Working with Stocks  
Stocks are the main types of items that Eggventory helps you to manage. Every Stock belongs to a Stock Type. For example, you may have the Stocks “500 ohm resistor” and “1k ohm resistor” in the Resistor Stock Type.  
  
Stocks may be Collective or Unique. Collective stocks consist of items that are not tracked individually. They generally are stocks that do not have each have their own serial number, and are considered interchangeable. Unique stocks are items that are often expensive or limited in quantity. Such stocks usually are each assigned a serial number, and are loaned out and tracked by this number. Stocks are set as Collective by default.  
  
Stocks have the following properties:  

| Property | Description |  
|---:|---| 
StockType|The category the stock belongs to. The StockType should have previously been added to the inventory system before being referenced.  
StockCode|A unique string of numbers and letters, used to identify the stock.  
Quantity | The number of items under the stock.
Description | The common name of the item.  
  
Note: Stock codes are not allowed to have spaces in them, and no two stocks can share the same stock code.  
  
#### 3.3.1 Adding new Stocks: `add stock`  
  
This adds a new stock to the inventory.

**[coming in v2.0]**  
In addition to the required parameters, stocks can also be added with the following optional parameters:  

Format|Purpose|  
|---|---|  
`-mq <MinQuantity>` |Sets the minimum quantity of stock that should be maintained in the inventory  
`-u`|Sets the stock to contain items that are unique  
  

Format: `add stock <StockType> <Stock Code> <Quantity> <Description> {<optional parameter>}`  
  
eg. `add stock Resistor R500 1000 500ohm resistor -mq 100`
